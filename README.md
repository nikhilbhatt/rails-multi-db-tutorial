# Multi-Tenant Application Demo

## Description

This project demonstrates a multi-tenant setup in Ruby on Rails using Rails multi-database architecture. It showcases how to implement multi-tenancy in both the main application and background jobs using Sidekiq.

The purpose of this project is to serve as a tutorial and practical example for developers looking to implement multi-tenancy in their Rails applications.

## Features

- Multi-tenant setup using Rails multi-database architecture
- Sidekiq integration for background job processing
- Multi-tenancy support in Sidekiq jobs
- Demonstration of separate databases for different tenants

```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd multi-tenant-application
```
3. Install dependencies:
```
bundle install
```
4. Set up the databases:
```
rails db:create

## Architecture Overview

This application demonstrates a multi-tenant architecture where:

1. Each tenant has its own database
2. The application dynamically connects to the appropriate database based on the tenant
3. Background jobs (using Sidekiq) maintain tenant context

[You might want to add a simple diagram here illustrating the architecture]
